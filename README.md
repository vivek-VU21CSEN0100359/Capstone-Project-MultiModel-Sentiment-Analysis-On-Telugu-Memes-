# Capstone-Project-MultiModel-Sentiment-Analysis-On-Telugu-Memes-
Developed a multimodal sentiment analysis system for Telugu memes by combining OCR-extracted text processed with NLP models (MuRIL, mBERT, XLM-R) and visual features from CNNs (VGG19, ResNet50). The fused model accurately classified sentiments, handling regional language and multimodal content challenges.
